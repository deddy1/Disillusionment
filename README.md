# Abstract:
This project uses OpenCV and Python to render a user invisible.

# Methodology:
To accomplish the objective, the program starts by capturing a still image of the background. This is overlaid with live video feed with the user.
The user can use a green screen or other solid color screen to block him or herself
from view of the camera. The program uses color identification to replace all pixels
with the specified color with the original background image.
